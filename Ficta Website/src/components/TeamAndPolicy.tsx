    description: "Having lived and worked across continents, I'm drawn by how culture shapes technology and behavior. Building for diverse markets means understanding not just language or UI, but what motivates people differently â€” what feels intuitive in one place may be surprising in another. I've found the best teams are the ones that mirror their users' diversity, where every perspective sharpens the product and expands its reach."
